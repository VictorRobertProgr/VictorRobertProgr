Hello there! I'm Victor and I'm new in this wonderful world of programming.
I'm really interersted in learning programming and in getting a solid base.
I'm currently learning JavaScript fundamentals. Really passionate about this new challenge in my life. Open and ready for any suggestion, help, contribution...
I'm looking to collaborate with who wants to have me as an apprentice. I'm really opened to any opportunities in this field.

Cheers!
