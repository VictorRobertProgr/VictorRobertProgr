Hello there! I'm Victor and I'm new in this wonderful world of programming.
I'm really interersted in learning programming and in getting a solid base.
I'm currently learning JavaScript fundamentals.
I'm looking to collaborate with who wants to have me as an apprentice. I'm reallly opened to any opportunities in this field.

Cheers!
